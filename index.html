                    Hello, my name is Kyle Church and I live in Frankton, Indiana. 
                    I currently work at Ball State University as an Assistant 
                    Instrutor of Computer Technology. I teach classes focusing around 
                    troubleshooting PC hardware, networking, systems administration, 
                    Linux, and board electronics. I received my Bachelors of Science 
                    from Ball State University majoring in Computer Information Systems,
                    and Logistics and Supply Chain Management. I also minored in Six
                    Sigma Quality Management, and Computer Technology. I received my 
                    Master's of Science from Ball State University majoring in 
                    Information and Communication Sciences. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I am currently taking a Full Stack Development Bootcamp through
                    Bulter University. I am hoping to learn more about website 
                    and application development, so that I can apply what I learn to my 
                    knowledge about IT. Networks and Systems are getting increasingly 
                    automated and virtualized, and understanding programming is becoming
                    increasingly important. I am also looking forward to expanding my
                    skills so that I can open myself up to new and exciting web 
                    development projects.
