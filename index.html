                Hello, my name is Kyle Church and I live in Frankton, Indiana. 
                I currently work at Ball State University as an Assistant 
                Instrutor of Computer Technology. I teach classes focusing around 
                troubleshooting PC hardware, networking, systems administration, 
                Linux, and board electronics. I received my Bachelors of Science 
                from Ball State University majoring in Computer Information Systems,
                and Logistics and Supply Chain Management. I also minored in Six
                Sigma Quality Management, and Computer Technology. I received my 
                Master's of Science from Ball State University majoring in 
                Information and Communication Sciences. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently taking a Full Stack Development Bootcamp through
                Bulter University. I am hoping to learn more about website 
                and application development, so that I can apply what I learn to my 
                knowledge about IT. Networks and Systems are getting increasingly 
                automated and virtualized, and understanding programming is becoming
                increasingly important. I am also looking forward to expanding my
                skills so that I can open myself up to new and exciting web 
                development projects. 
            </p>
